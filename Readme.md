Address TDD Project
================================

This project is built specifically to be a TDD exercise to accompany a blog post 
about using NCrunch. 

The actual programming topic is both easier and harder than you might expect, as
it focuses on building a single class that implements rules for formatting a
mailing address. Unfortunately this task is both just as easy and quite a bit 
harder than you might expect, as the actual rules for mailing addresses are 
quite a bit more difficult than you would expect.

The main branch will be setup to provide a clean, ready to go pair of projects.

Requirements:

- Visual Studio 2010
- NCrunch: http://www.ncrunch.net/
- Some music
